# About
This Leave Management System developed using Angular is used to track employee leaves and get analysis of every employee and their leaves in any type, also every employee has a seperate page to request a leave, get info about previous leaves and preview all this in a calendar form.



  
     
# Main Features
## Admin/Employee Roles
Admins can manage their teams by creating, editing, or deleting employee records. They can also respond to leave requests, view current requests, and review all past ones. Employees can see their leave history and submit new leave requests.

## Dashboard
The dashboard contains details about each leave type, including allowed days, total leaves requested, and the number of days allocated for each leave type. It also displays the most frequently used leave types (Vacation & Sick) with a user-friendly progress bar.

## Calendar
Users can view all leaves by selecting a year, which will display a full calendar with leave statuses color-coded and detailed information available by hovering or clicking on a date. Admins can also select a month to view the leaves of all their employees.
